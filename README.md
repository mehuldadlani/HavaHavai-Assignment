# Stacked Architecture Flutter App Template

Welcome to the Stacked Architecture Flutter App Template! ðŸš€

## Overview

The Stacked architecture is like building blocks for your Flutter apps! It helps you keep your code organized and easy to maintain. Here's a quick rundown:

- **ViewModels**: These manage your app's logic and state.
- **Services**: They handle things like fetching data and performing other tasks.
- **Views**: These are what your users see and interact with.

Check out the [Stacked architecture documentation](https://stacked.filledstacks.com/docs/getting-started/overview) for more details!

## Template Structure

In this template, you'll find:

- **ViewModels**: Keep your logic here! They live in the `viewmodels` directory.
- **Services**: Need to interact with APIs or databases? Look in the `services` directory!
- **Views**: The user interface is in the `views` directory.
